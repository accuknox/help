## Cloud-Native Deployment Challenges

Cloud-native environments bring innovation but also introduce unique security challenges at each stage:

### Code Build Phase

- Hardcoded secrets.
- Insecure configurations.
- Vulnerable dependencies in open-source code.

### Deployment Phase

- Image poisoning.
- Insecure CI/CD pipelines.
- Exploitable vulnerabilities.

### Runtime Phase

- Zero-day attacks.
- Crypto-mining and lateral movement.
- Data exfiltration and undetected malware.

## AccuKnox AppSec + CloudSec CNAPP

AccuKnoxâ€™s **Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP)** simplifies cloud security by addressing threats holistically:

- **ASPM**: Application Shift-Left Security.
- **CSPM**: Cloud Infrastructure Security.
- **CWPP**: Runtime Workload Protection.
- **KIEM**: Kubernetes Identity Management.
- **GRC**: Governance, Risk, and Compliance.

By integrating these modules, AccuKnox ensures comprehensive coverage of code, cloud, container, and cluster (4C) assets.
