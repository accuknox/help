**Note: Since the AccuKnox team had done a major upgrade the existing clusters/VMs that are onboarded to the AccuKnox Demo environment need to be upgraded.**

- For Clusters:
`helm upgrade --install accuknox-agents oci://registry-1.docker.io/accuknox/accuknox-agents  --version "v0.6.5" -n accuknox-agents`

- For VMS:
Users need to deboard control plane nodes using `knoxctl deboard cp-node` and re onboard the control plane  following instructions from the Manage clusters page.

For further queries and details please contact the AccuKnox support team.
We hope you like the enhanced security and improved features of AccuKnox v2.0!

### **Detailed Outline:**

**1. Agentless Risk Assessment for Kubernetes Clusters**

Kubernetes clusters related misconfiguration can be viewed with the help of AccuKnox jobs. These can scan and report issues related to Various benchmarks like CIS, NIST, SOC2. Our jobs can also scan for misconfigurations in the kubernetes clusters.

-   **CIS Benchmarks(K8s):**
    AccuKnox CNAPP already supported CIS Benchmarks for Cloud accounts. Now AccuKnox CNAPP supports these CIS Benchmarks for k8s clusters against various misconfigurations. AccuKnox provides the CIS benchmarks related findings with the help of its agentless risk assessment job.

**2. IaC Scanning**

To see the vulnerabilities related to the Configuration files like Terraform, Helm charts, YAML files that are present in your GitHub, Gitlab and Bitbucket repositories.

**3. Application behavior monitoring made easier**

-   **App Behavior - Namespace and Cluster Level View:** Enhanced app behavior monitoring with detailed views at the namespace and cluster levels

![](images/release-notes/v2-release-4.png)

-   **App Behavior of VM Workloads:** Now users can see the application behavior for their onboarded VMs as well. This gives the process and network connections that are made by the application running in the VMs

**4. PSA and Reporting**

-   **Pod Security Admission (PSA):** The Pod Security Admission features now permit enforcing Pod Security Standards at the namespace level with flexible configuration and application. It provides apparent visualization for security postures in the Namespace Security Posture view and audit results in the Monitors/Alerts view. We also have a dry run feature which can be used to check the PSA policies without having to apply in the cluster.

**5. Kubernetes Identity And Entitlement  Management(KIEM)(BETA)**

AccuKnox KIEM's solution uses RBAC to manage access to Kubernetes resources more easily with graph visualization and full-text search. Users can filter on restrictions like roles, rules, verbs, and service accounts on the KIEM's overview page, which presents all permissions. We also include pre-defined key queries to investigate important entities and their relationships. You can now view connections, find excessively permissive permissions, and search across all RBAC entities. Users can check this feature by Navigating to Identity->KIEM. This will be Beta feature now as there is still improvements being made by the team.

Users can achieve their zero trust journey easier with the help of new feature called the stable tag in the policies. Now the users will be notified with the 'stable' tag against each and every discovered policies which are not getting any updates based on the application behavior. So users can easily apply those policies to achieve their zero trust journey.
