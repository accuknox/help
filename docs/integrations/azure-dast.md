2.  Add the following task under the `steps` block:

```
steps:
  - task: accuknox-dast@0
    inputs:
      targetURL: $(TARGET_URL)
      accuknoxEndpoint: $(ACCUKNOX_ENDPOINT)
      accuknoxToken: $(ACCUKNOX_TOKEN)
      accuknoxLabel: $(ACCUKNOX_LABEL)
      scanType: $(SCAN_TYPE)
      qualityGate: $(QUALITY_GATE)

```

### **Step 5: Run the Pipeline**

1.  Trigger the pipeline manually or through a code change.

2.  Monitor the pipeline logs to verify that the AccuKnox DAST task is running successfully.
