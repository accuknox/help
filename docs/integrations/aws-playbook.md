**Step 8:** This information is forwarded to AccuKnox Support, and after verification by our support team, a confirmation email is sent.

**Step 9:** At this juncture, we strongly recommend scheduling a DEMO with AccuKnox to assist the customer with the onboarding steps and gain a deeper understanding of our features.

**Step 10:** Shortly after configuring a tenant for the customer, we will send them an invitation to access the SaaS platform and leverage its security features.

**Note:** The subscription options present on the marketplace are only available to the user for a month. After one month, we will be revoking all access of the user to our Saas Platform. Hence, Before the end of the monthly subscription,  We ask the customer to Disable any recurring subscription they have with the contract. If User still wants to continue using the platform they can refer to case 3 & 4. 

### **Case 2:** Customer gets to know about AccuKnox through Demo interaction and wants to purchase the subscription through AWS. 

To proceed in this process, the customer should have a good understanding of the platform since these initial steps should have already been completed:

- Introduction to AccuKnox CNAPP
- Live Platform Demo, Covering Various Use Cases
- Proof of Concept (POC) Conducted in Their Environment

**Step 1:** Following discussions about licensing and pricing, we can tailor a private offer specifically for the organization to meet their requirements.

**Step 2:** This private offer will be associated with a particular AWS account, so the organization must provide their AWS account number.

**Step 3:** After creating and obtaining approval from AWS for the private offer, it will be listed on the marketplace for the provided AWS account.

**Step 4:** The customer should then log in to that AWS account, search for AccuKnox CNAPP on the marketplace, and locate the private offer to initiate the contract signing.

### **Case 3:** User already has a Trial/Starter Pack subscription and wants to continue the contract.

The Offers listed on the MarketPlace are one time (except Free Forever Plan) and available to a user only for a single month only. These offers are meant for trial purposes only. If the user wants to continue using the product they can contact the support team and we will create a Private Offer that adheres to our policies and works best for you.

After the Private Offer is created, User can refer to “Case 2” to see the next steps. 

## **What to expect from AccuKnox after successful Subscription and Registration?**

Upon confirmation of the contract and subscription, AccuKnox Support will contact the customer via the email address provided during registration to acknowledge their subscription.

Following this, the AccuKnox team will proceed to provision a dedicated tenant and subsequently share the access credentials with the customer. This access will include a username and a temporary password for accessing the <a href="https://app.accuknox.com" target="_blank">AccuKnox SaaS platform</a>. Upon initial login, users will be prompted to configure multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
