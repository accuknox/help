# CI/CD Integrations Overview

**CI/CD Support Matrix** provides a structured overview of supported capabilities and integration types across popular CI/CD platforms. This helps teams align their DevOps processes with available tools and identify the best fit for their workflows.

Our approach to CI/CD pipeline integration is not just about connecting tools‚Äîit's about creating a unified, automated security fabric that protects your applications from code to cloud. We focus on three core pillars: proactive vulnerability prevention, real-time threat detection, and continuous supply chain hardening. By shifting security left, we ensure every stage of your development lifecycle is fortified against modern attacks.

=== "Continuous API Security"
    !!! tip ""
        üöÄ Instead of relying on infrequent manual penetration tests,
        our solution integrates **DAST** into your CI/CD pipeline.

        - Continuous, automated endpoint testing
        - Real-time alerts for new flaws
        - Prevents risks from frequent updates

=== "Integrated SAST & Secrets Scanning"
    !!! success ""
        üîí Enable dev teams to **scan code and configs inline** with PRs.

        - Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
        - Secrets & sensitive data detection
        - Blocks merges until baseline is met

=== "CI/CD Pipeline Hardening"
    !!! warning ""
        üõ°Ô∏è Secure your software supply chain by **validating executions**.

        - Monitors CI/CD for improper behavior
        - Detects unauthorized execution paths
        - Prevents hidden supply chain attacks
