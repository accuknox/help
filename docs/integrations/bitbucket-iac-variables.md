# Bitbucket Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Scanning Variables

The Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning section of the Bitbucket CI/CD pipeline is designed to integrate with AccuKnox to scan infrastructure code files (e.g., Terraform) for security vulnerabilities.

Hereâ€™s the table that outlines the inputs and their descriptions, along with default values:

| Input Value        | Description                                                                 | Default Value                |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **INPUT_FILE**     | Specify a file for scanning (e.g., ".tf" for Terraform). Cannot be used with directory input. | "" (empty, optional)         |
| **INPUT_DIRECTORY**| Directory with infrastructure code and/or package manager files to scan.    | "." (current directory)      |
| **INPUT_COMPACT**  | Do not display code blocks in the output.                                   | true (boolean)               |
| **INPUT_QUIET**    | Display only failed checks.                                                 | true (boolean)               |
| **INPUT_SOFT_FAIL**| Do not return an error code if there are failed checks.                     | true (boolean)               |
| **INPUT_FRAMEWORK**| Run only on a specific infrastructure (Kubernetes or Terraform).            | "" (empty, optional)         |
| **ACCUKNOX_TOKEN** | The token for authenticating with the CSPM panel.                           | N/A (Required)               |
| **ACCUKNOX_TENANT**| ID of the tenant associated with the CSPM panel.                            | N/A (Required)               |
| **ACCUKNOX_ENDPOINT** | URL of the CSPM panel to push the scan results to.                       | cspm.demo.accuknox.com       |
