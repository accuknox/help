# Azure Compute Security

Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) are integral to cloud-based operations, hosting critical applications and sensitive data. Ensuring their security is vital to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational downtime.

AccuKnox CSPM provides continuous monitoring and real-time detection of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in Azure VMs. It delivers actionable insights and automated remediation workflows, ensuring compliance with security standards and robust protection against potential threats.

One major security challenge with Azure VMs lies in **publicly exposed VM disks**. These misconfigurations can leave sensitive data vulnerable to exploitation, making it essential to address them proactively.

## **Why is VM Disk Public Access a Risk**

When a VM disk is publicly exposed, it becomes a target for malicious attackers. Unauthorized access can lead to:

- **Data Exposure**: Sensitive data can be copied or leaked.

- **Malicious Modifications**: Attackers may alter files, plant malware, or tamper with critical system configurations.

- **Compliance Violations**: Exposure violates compliance standards like GDPR, HIPAA, or ISO, leading to potential legal and financial repercussions.

## **Attack Scenario**

An attacker uses scanning tools to scan the Internet for publicly accessible VM disks. Upon finding a vulnerable disk, they gain access, exfiltrate sensitive data, or plant malicious files. This can result in data breaches, operational disruptions, or financial losses.
