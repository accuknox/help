# Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)

CSPM refers to a category of tools and practices used to manage and improve the security posture of cloud environments, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. CSPM helps organizations ensure their cloud resources and configurations comply with security best practices, industry standards, and regulatory requirements.

Accuknox helps users by providing continuous compliance, asset inventory, misconfiguration findings, Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC).
