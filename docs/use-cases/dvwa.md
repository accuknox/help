## **DVWA:** 
Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. Its main goal is to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications, and to aid both students & teachers to learn about web application security in a controlled classroom environment.

### **DVWA Attack Points:**
+ Command Injection: 
Attacks on the insecure transmission of User data

+ CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery): The attacker Froges as original site and makes the user click the link and steal data. Here either cookies or form data is stolen

+ SQL Injection: Attacker can make use of this to get unauthorized to Database access

+ CSP(Content Security Policy): If the particular domain is allowed then a malicious script from that domain can be executed. 

DVWA web Application is deployed in the cluster in the dvwa namespace. It has Web and MySQL pod running with 2 services. 

## **Observability:** 

Once the cluster with the DVWA application is onboarded we can see the application behavior by Navigating to the Runtime Security->App Behavior section. In the screen the select cluster name and namespace in which the DVWA  application is deployed.

**1.Network Observability:** It gives data related to network connections happening in the pod

**2.File Observability:** It gives information regarding files that are being accessed in the pod

**3.Process Observability:** It shows the process that is being executed in the pod.

## **Protection Using AccuKnox:** 
According to the application behavior, the WordPress pod running in the DVWA uses 2 processes ping and apache2. So we are going to whitelist only these 2 processes and block other processes from execution in the WordPress pod. 

- **Before Applying policy:** 

Before applying our KubeArmor Security policy we can see that along with ping other processes are also can be executed.

- **Applying the KubeArmor policy:** 

**Step 1:** Navigate to the *Runtime Protection-> Policies* and select the cluster and namespace where the DVWA application is deployed.

**Step 2:** In the screen select the discovered policies in the policy filter section to view the auto-discovered policies for the DVWA application.

**Step 3:** Click on the auto-discovered system policy for the dvwa web pod to see the policy

The policy allows the necessary processes like ping and apache2 to execute. 

```bash

```

**Step 4:** To apply this policy, select the policy checkbox and click Apply option

**Step 8:** Now if we try to execute any other processes inside the dvwa pod it will be blocked.
