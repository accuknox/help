    Protect access to k8s service account token
  image: images/uc/cert-file.png
  details:
    description: >
      K8s mounts the service account token as part of every pod by
      default. The service account token is a credential that can be used as a
      bearer token to access k8s APIs and gain access to other k8s entities.
      Many times there are no processes in the pod that use the service account
      tokens which means in such cases the k8s service account token is an
      unused asset that can be leveraged by the attacker.
    attackscenario: >
      An attacker would check for credential accesses so as to do
      lateral movements. For example, in most K8s attacks, the attacker after
      gaining entry into the K8s pods tries to use a service account token and
      gain access to other entities.

      Pods/Containers might get shipped with binaries which should never used in the production environments. Some of those bins might be useful in dev/staging environments but the same container image is carried forward in most cases to the production environment too. For security reasons, the devsecops team might want to disable the use of these binaries in the production environment even though the bins exists in the container. As an example, most of the container images are shipped with package management tools such as apk, apt, yum, etc. If anyone ends up using these bins in the prod env, it will increase the attack surface of the container/pod.
    attackscenario: >

      Adversaries may install a root certificate on a compromised system to avoid warnings when connecting to adversary-controlled web servers. Root certificates are used in public key cryptography to identify a root certificate authority (CA). When a root certificate is installed, the system or application will trust certificates in the root's chain of trust that have been signed by the root certificate. Installation of a root certificate on a compromised system would give an adversary a way to degrade the security of that system.
    attackscenario: >
      Adversaries have used this technique to avoid security warnings prompting users when compromised systems connect over HTTPS to adversary-controlled web servers that spoof legitimate websites in order to collect login credentials.

Location, format, and type of artifact (such as command or login history) are often specific to each platform. 
    attackscenario: >
      Removal of these indicators may interfere with event collection, reporting, or other processes used to detect intrusion activity. This may compromise the integrity of security solutions by causing notable events to go unreported. This activity may also impede forensic analysis and incident response, due to a lack of sufficient data to determine what occurred.
