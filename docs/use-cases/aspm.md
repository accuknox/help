# ASPM (Application Security Posture Management)

**ASPM** provides a continuous and integrated security framework, enabling organizations to gain real-time insights into their application landscape. Unlike traditional siloed approaches, **ASPM** embeds visibility, assessment, and risk mitigation into every phase of the development lifecycle, fostering seamless collaboration between security and development teams.

**AccuKnox** enables organizations to streamline their security practices through features that promote broad application visibility, risk-based prioritization, and comprehensive security management. Integrating seamlessly with a wide range of development and security tools ensures that teams can maintain a high-performing security framework across diverse environments, achieving enhanced protection and compliance.

## **Key Features**

-   **Unified Security Test Orchestration**: Integrates **SAST**, **DAST**, **SCA**, and other security testing tools into a streamlined workflow for efficient vulnerability detection.

-   **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**: Embeds security checks into development pipelines, enabling early vulnerability identification and remediation to support a shift-left security approach.

-   **Context-Driven Risk Prioritization**: Leverages contextual data to identify and address critical vulnerabilities, ensuring the protection of business-critical assets.

-   **End-to-End Security Coverage**: Protects applications across all layers, from code to infrastructure, while providing real-time visibility into security gaps.

-   **Continuous Improvement**: Monitor and assess the effectiveness of your security posture over time, with actionable insights to refine your strategy and reduce vulnerabilities across the board.

-   **Built-in scanners with Advanced Capabilities:** Our **IaC Scanning** and **Container Scanning** are purpose-built to detect misconfigurations and vulnerabilities within your infrastructure. Support for **self-hosted and isolated registries** ensures your data remains secure and within your control, aligning with enterprise-grade compliance needs
