# Automated Ticket Creation using Rules Engine

The Rules Engine allows users to customize and automate ticket creation by selecting the data type, defining the criticality, and configuring specific ticket settings. This ensures that customized tickets are created whenever the selected criteria is met, providing more control over the ticketing process.

In this section we can find the steps to create a ticket using Rule Engine in the AccuKnox platform.

## Prerequisites

A ticketing platform integrated to AccuKnox with a ticketing configuration created

**Note:** If the ticketing platform is not integrated yet, please follow the steps specified in the [Ticketing section](https://help.accuknox.com/integrations/jira-cloud/ "https://help.accuknox.com/integrations/jira-cloud/") for the platform you are using.
