Accuknox integrates with ClamAV to extend the host scanning capabilities to Windows/Linux machines.

ClamAV is an Open-source antivirus engine developed by Cisco, for detecting malware, viruses, trojans, and other security threats, specially designed for e-mail scanning on mail gateways.

## UseCases

### Quick scan

ClamAV is optimized to scan files. Scans can be triggered on multiple files or directories by using the include/exclude option. Users can see the scan results in the SaaS and then quarantine or delete the infected files.

In the below example result, the scan ran against the URL (https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com.txt), consisting of a malicious text file. ClamAV detected and raised it in the scan results with the matched virus signature as shown below.

```sh
$ curl https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com.txt | clamscan -
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current

The CVD (ClamAV Virus Database) files are a collection of signatures, actively maintained by the Cisco Talos team. A digitally signed container that wraps the signatures to ensure no malicious third party can modify it. The SaaS integration can run scans against 8M+ trusted signatures.

### Scan remote-jobs

Using the SaaS platform, scans can be triggered for Linux and Windows operating systems using remote jobs-based options.

### Real-time protection for Linux

The ```ClamOnAcc``` client utilizes the ```ClamD``` daemon to provide on-access scanning. This includes preventing access to a file until it has been scanned.

### Protect against archive bombs

A malicious archive file can disable a system or a program while unpacked. Archive bombs consume too much CPU and memory and excessively load the system.

The SaaS integration can protect from these malicious files by taking the archives as input and then extracting and scanning them against trusted ClamAV database out of the box. It can scan against the archive formats below:

??? "Supported archive formats"

    + RAR (most versions)
    + 7Zip
    + Zip (exclude some extensions)
    + Tar
    + XZ
    + Gzip
    + Bzip2
    + XAR
    + ARJ
    + IMG
    + ISO 9660
    + PKG
    + Microsoft OLE2
    + Microsoft OOXML (Office documents)
    + Microsoft Cabinet Files (including SFX)
    + Microsoft CHM (Compiled HTML)
    + Microsoft SZDD compression format and others

### Scan Windows Portable Executables(PE)

Portable Executables(PE) is a data structure that contains the information required for the Windows OS loader to handle the executables. The ClamAV integration can scan Windows executable files for both 32/64 bit and protect them from attacks like process injection and back-door implementation. The below compression formats are supported for scanning:

??? "Supported compression formats"

    + PeSpin
    + UPX
    + AsPack
    + MEW
    + FSG
    + NsPack
    + Petite
    + Y0da Cryptor
    + Upack
    + wwpack32

### Scan mail Attachments

Mail attachments can contain malicious files that can trigger suspicious activities. From the Accuknox SaaS, we can scan these mail attachments before opening or even downloading them and protect users from viruses, malware, or other potentially dangerous code. Almost all mail file formats can be scanned from the SaaS UI.

### Detect PII in text files

PII stands for personally identifiable information. The ClamAV integration will allow users to check for sensitive information in their emails e.g. bank details, credit card information, etc from the Accuknox SaaS itself. It will utilize the ```libclamav``` package to detect and flag credit card information in the SaaS. The below credit card issuers are supported:

??? "Supported credit card issuers"

    + VISA
    + MasterCard
    + AMEX
    + Discover
    + Diner's Club
    + JCB
    + U.S. social security numbers inside text files
