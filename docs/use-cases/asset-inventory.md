# Asset Inventory Guide

Users with multiple cloud accounts and workloads across various public clouds often face challenges in getting a comprehensive view of their cloud assets in a single place. Switching between various cloud provider consoles to monitor these assets becomes a huge problem.

AccuKnox solves this user problem by providing a **single pane of view** for cloud accounts, assets, and workloads present across multiple cloud platforms.

Once the user onboards the cloud account, the **AccuKnox CSPM tool scans** the cloud account for assets like hosts, applications, Web APIs, containers, clusters, and more. Asset count will increase or decrease based on changes in the onboarded cloud account. This is handled by **periodic scans** that the AccuKnox CSPM tool runs at fixed time intervals.

AccuKnox gives users the ability to view their assets from **two different perspectives**.

## Step 1: Accessing Asset Inventory

To access the **‚ÄòAsset Inventory‚Äô**, the first step is to:

- Click on **‚ÄòInventory‚Äô**
- Then click on **‚ÄòCloud Assets‚Äô**

## Step 2: List Perspective

Inside **‚ÄòCloud Assets‚Äô**, users have the assets displayed in the **list perspective**, which separates them by **‚ÄòAsset Category‚Äô** and provides other useful information such as the findings associated with that category.

## Step 3: Hierarchy Perspective

The second perspective is the **hierarchy view**, which can be accessed by clicking on the **blue button** on the right side of the screen.

The **hierarchical perspective** provides users with a different view of their onboarded assets, giving **versatility and options** that satisfy their needs.

## Step 4: Using Dashboard Widgets

Widgets on the main dashboard are another opportunity to get useful insights about assets. **Asset findings** will be listed along with a **graphical view** of asset findings that can be explored further.

When the user clicks one of the assets from the list, they will get detailed information such as:

- Asset name

- Vulnerability name
- Message
- Risk factor
- Description
- When the vulnerability was scanned
