??? "**4. Does AccuKnox provide auto discovery of assets and workloads?**"
    Yes, AccuKnox can auto discover assets in the cloud by leveraging the cloud native tools.

    For workloads, AccuKnox agents will provide the visibility data.

??? "**5. Do I need to enable native security services for AWS to get data into Accuknox?**"
    AccuKnox only requires an IAM role to be created with read only access to be able to get data from AWS. Security Hub and Macie can be optionally enabled for AccuKnox to gather richer telemetry data with more context.

??? "**6. What are the Hypervisors or Virtualized Environments that are supported by AccuKnox?**"
    AccuKnox technology does not integrate at the VM virtualization layer. AccuKnox tech integrates at the operating system layer and ensures that the right hardening/enforcement for process executions, network access, and file access is in place. Thus AccuKnox can operate on any virtualization tech provided that the underlying VM uses Linux as its operating system.

??? "**7. What are the integration tools and registries that are supported by AccuKnox?**"
    AccuKnox can integrate multiple Cloud Account, Registries, SIEM platform, Ticketing or Notifications Tools and the list is ever growing. AccuKnox is pretty flexible to support the progression of the list with the customer’s request as our roadmap item. Some of the supported today are as follows:

    + Security Events/SIEM : Splunk, Rsyslog, AWS CloudWatch, Elastic Search, Webhooks, Azure Sentinel

    + Notification Tools: Slack, Jira, PagerDuty, Emails

    + Ticketing Tools: Jira, FreshService, Connectwise, Zendesk

    + Registries: Nexus, ECR, GCR, DockerHub, ACR, Harbor

??? "**8. Can AccuKnox help in Monitoring?**"
    + With Accuknox, you can create monitors for assets or group of assets to get alerts for changes observed in their Metadata (software version etc)

    + Our Drift detection capability is inherently doing monitoring of the compliance checks (pass/fail) that have changed between scans.

    + We collect alerts and telemetry generated by Kubearmor and cillium. These alerts are part of our CWPP offering. These alerts are generated for the events that have violated/complied with a policy.

    + For these alerts you can have notification enabled as well through channels like Slack, email etc.

??? "**9. What will happen to my application running on a VM?**"
    You get hardening policies via AccuKnox enforcement engine KubeArmor.

??? "**10. Is AccuKnox more of a CNAPP solution or a Zero Trust solution?**"
    AccuKnox is a **Zero Trust CNAPP** solution.

    + CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform) defines the product category for securing cloud-native infrastructure and applications.
    + Zero Trust is a **security philosophy**.

    AccuKnox integrates both by applying **least-permissive, allow-specific and deny-rest** policies across cloud-native apps and infrastructure.

## CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management)

??? "**1. Does AccuKnox CNAPP support only agent-based scanning or does it support agentless scanning ?**"
    For CSPM, AccuKnox supports agentless scanning for Public Cloud Infrastructure. For Infrastructure behind a firewall or Private Cloud, AccuKnox CSPM leverages open source based agent to manage remote nodes for Automated reporting, Error log Delivery, Microservice Monitoring, User Shell Activity, Resource Monitoring.

    For CWPP, AccuKnox leverages the open source CNCF sandbox project **KubeArmor** for scanning and in-line mitigation from known attacks. Together we provide a complete static and runtime security for a variety of workloads whether they are on Public/Private Cloud, VM, Baremetal or pure-containerized workload. Thus, we require agents to be installed to support scanning the workloads.

??? "**2. What is the differentiation of AccuKnox in Static Security?**"
    In the Static Security solution, unlike other CSPM tools, AccuKnox provides flexibility to integrate a variety of open source and commercial security scanning tools through built-in parsers to provide you a composite security posture of your infrastructure. We also correlate and normalize results from a variety of security scanning tools and provide detailed results of vulnerabilities across infrastructure.

??? "**3. How does AccuKnox help to achieve static security?**"
    AccuKnox Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tool scans the Cloud Account to assess Vulnerabilities, Misconfigurations that are present in the cloud infrastructure based on security best practices & benchmarks. AccuKnox also enables you to handle Vulnerabilities with the ability to mark false positives, Waiting for 3rd party or Accepted risk and many more, so that you get to act on findings that are remediable and within the SLA. We also give comprehensive compliance reports based on various security governance for third party assessment operators (3PAO) auditing.

## ASPM (Application Security Posture Management)

??? "**1. What is the differentiation of AccuKnox in ASPM Security?**"
    In the ASPM Security solution, unlike other tools, AccuKnox provides flexibility to integrate a variety of open source and commercial security scanning tools through built-in parsers to provide you a composite security posture of your infrastructure. This is mainly done for the following two contexts:

    + Remove dependencies and scoped results from one tool
    + Bring in contextual understanding of vulnerabilities and prioritization based on that

    Further on this, we also correlate and normalize results from a variety of security scanning tools and provide detailed results of vulnerabilities across infrastructure.

## Runtime Security (CWPP & KubeArmor)

??? "**1. How does AccuKnox help to achieve Runtime security?**"
    AccuKnox’s Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) achieves runtime security by leveraging CNCF sandbox project, KubeArmor, which is a cloud-native runtime security enforcement system by AccuKnox that restricts and have more granular control over the application behavior such as process execution, file access, and networking operation of containers and nodes at the system level.

??? "**2. What is the differentiation of AccuKnox in Runtime Security?**"
    AccuKnox leverages KubeArmor, which is a cloud-native runtime security enforcement system that leverages Linux Security Modules to secure the workloads. LSMs are really powerful but they weren’t built with modern workloads including Containers and Orchestrators in mind. Hence, eBPF has provided us with the ability to extend capabilities and BPF LSM provide us with the ability to load our custom programs with decision-making into the kernel seamlessly helping us protect modern workloads. Therefore, KubeArmor helps to enforce security posture wherein any malicious attacks will be stopped before execution, known as in-line mitigation (mentioned by Forrester report)

??? "**3. What does KubeArmor leverage for enforcement and what are its advantages?**"
    KubeArmor leverages best of breed Linux Security Modules (LSMs) such as AppArmor, BPF-LSM, and SELinux for inline mitigation to reduce the attack surface of the pod/container/VM.LSMs have several advantages over any other techniques. By using LSMs, KubeArmor does not have to disturb pods/containers and also doesn't require change at host or CRI level to apply security policies.

    KubeArmor deploys as a non-privileged daemonset with certain capabilities that allows it to monitor other pods/containers and host. A given cluster can have multiple nodes utilizing different LSMs so KubeArmor abstracts away the complexities of the LSMs and provides an easy way for policy enforcement.

??? "**4. What role does AccuKnox Agents play in runtime-security?**"
    AccuKnox Enterprise version consists of various agents such as

    **KubeArmor:** KubeArmor is a cloud-native runtime security enforcement system that restricts the behavior (such as process execution, file access, and networking operation) of containers and nodes at the system level. KubeArmor dynamically set the restrictions on the pod. KubeArmor leverages Linux Security Modules (LSMs) to enforce policies at runtime.

    **Feeder Service:** It collects the feeds from kubeArmor and relays to the app.

    **Shared Informer Agent:** It collects information about the cluster like pods, nodes, namespaces etc.,

    **Policy Discovery Engine:** It discovers the policies using the workload and cluster information that is relayed by a shared informer Agent.

??? "**5. Does KubeArmor only support Kubernetes or it can support on-prem deployments like legacy VM, pure containerized workload as well?**"
    KubeArmor supports following types of workloads:

    + K8s orchestrated workloads: Workloads deployed as k8s orchestrated containers. In this case, KubeArmor is deployed as a k8s daemonset. Note, KubeArmor supports policy enforcement on both k8s-pods (KubeArmorPolicy) as well as k8s-nodes (KubeArmorHostPolicy).
    + VM/Bare-Metals workloads: Workloads deployed on Virtual Machines or Bare Metal i.e. workloads directly operating as host processes. In this case, KubeArmor is deployed in systemd mode.

??? "**6. What is the difference between Post-attack mitigation and in-line mitigation and which is better?**"
    Post-exploit Mitigation works by killing the suspicious process in response to an alert indicating malicious intent. In this case attacker will be allowed to is able to execute its binary and could possibly disable the security controls, access logs, etc to circumvent the attack detection. By the time the malicious process is killed, it might have already deleted, encrypted, or transmitted the sensitive contents.

    ![post attack mitigation](/faqs/images/post-attack-mitigation.png)

    Inline Mitigation on the other hand prevents the malicious attack at the time of happening itself. It doesn’t allow the attack to happen by protecting the environment with security policy or firewall. AccuKnox’s open source tool KubeArmor provides Inline Mitigation. KubeArmor uses inline mitigation to reduce the attack surface of pod/container/VM. KubeArmor leverages best of breed Linux Security Modules (LSMs) such as AppArmor, BPF-LSM, and SELinux (only for host protection) for inline mitigation

??? "**7. Does Inline remediation slowdown the process?**"
    LSMs are already enabled in the environment and use host based LSM security. Since the attacker usually has direct access to the pod, AccuKnox uses Inline remediation to stop the processes before executing. Therefore, inline remediation does not slow down the process

??? "**8. How to check running services in a VM?**"
    To troubleshoot or verify if required services are running inside a Virtual Machine, use the following commands:

    - To check if a specific service (e.g., `kubearmor`, `vm-adapter`) is running:

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl status <service_name>  # Replace with actual service name

    sudo systemctl status kubearmor
    sudo systemctl status vm-adapter
    ```

    - To list all currently running services:

    ```sh
    systemctl --type=service --state=running
    ```

    This helps confirm whether KubeArmor or other critical services are active inside the VM for proper enforcement and telemetry.

## Policy Management & Enforcement

??? "**1. How AccuKnox helps in Policy Version Control for Runtime Security?**"
    Accknox enables DevSecOps teams to embed security policies as code into their GitOps workflow. This provides a unified, collaborative view of the policies and enables them to be shipped and deployed along with the applications they are protecting. Hence, utilizing Gitops based policy version control, it will be easy to enforce changes to policies and keep track of versions in case of audit or rollback requirement alongwith approval mechanisms.

??? "**2. How AccuKnox helps to achieve Microsegmentation?**"
    AccuKnox CWPP provides micro-segmentation at the lowest possible granularity level which is also a smallest execution unit in Kubernetes i.e. Pods. We will help you to identify process execution request from the pods, network connections the pods are trying to make internally or externally and files-system the pods are accessing. By observing the behavior of a particular pod and restricting that behavior so that it functions according to the expected flow of process/events/traffic, one can develop a least permissive security posture from creating a whitelisting policies and auditing/denying everything else.

??? "**3. How AccuKnox helps to recommend Auto-Discovered Policies?**"
    AccuKnox CWPP solution provide Discovery Engine agent that assesses the security posture of your workloads and auto-discovers the policy-set required to put the workload in least-permissive mode. We also provide Shared Informer Agent which collects information about cluster like pods, nodes, namespaces etc. The Policy Discovery Engine discovers the policies using the workload and cluster information that is relayed by Shared Informer Agent.

??? "**4. What are Hardening Policies?**"
    KubeArmor is a security solution for the Kubernetes and cloud native platforms that helps protect your workloads from attacks and threats. It does this by providing a set of hardening policies that are based on industry-leading compliance and attack frameworks such as CIS, MITRE, NIST-800-53, and STIGs. These policies are designed to help you secure your workloads in a way that is compliant with these frameworks and recommended best practices.

??? "**5. What is Network Segmentation?**"
    In Kubernetes, the network policy resource is a set of network traffic rules that are applied to a group of pods in a Kubernetes cluster. The network policy specifies how a pod is allowed to communicate with others. Network policy controllers (running as pods in the Kubernetes cluster) convert the requirements and restrictions of the network policies that are retrieved from the Kubernetes API into the network infrastructure.

??? "**6. How AccuKnox helps to implement Zero Trust?**"
    By implementing a zero trust posture with KubeArmor, organizations can increase their security posture and reduce the risk of unauthorized access or activity within their Kubernetes clusters. This can help to protect sensitive data, prevent system breaches, and maintain the integrity of the cluster.
    KubeArmor supports allow-based policies which result in specific actions to be allowed and denying/auditing everything else. For example, a specific pod/container might only invoke a set of binaries at runtime. As part of allow-based rules you can specify the set of processes that are allowed and everything else is either audited or denied based on the default security posture.

??? "**7. What does AccuKnox measure, while doing security posture observation and how does it help in securing using policies?**"
    + Compliance Frameworks (MITRE, CIS, NIST) for hardening workloads are used to create hardening policies
    + Understanding the Application behaviour using LSMs enables creation of behavioural policies
    + Hardening policies are block based policies
    + Behavioural policies are allow based policies
    + An example of policies is FIM (File Integrity Monitoring) policy

??? "**8. Do you have any standard hardening rules onboarded and will the hardening policy show what is getting blocked?**"
    Yes, it can show up in terms of Application Behaviour & Logs

## Compliance & Auditing

??? "**1. What are all the compliance frameworks that AccuKnox is covering?**"
    AccuKnox’s CNAPP tool checks for compliance and governance from various benchmarks like STIG, CIS, NIST CSF, HIPAA, MITRE, SOC2, ISO 27001.


## Deployment & Architecture

??? "**1. What is the deployment architecture?**"
    + Applications -
    + For Kubernetes - Daemonset
    + For Containers, VM -  Systemd mode
    + Infrastructure -
    + Public Cloud - Agentless (API Scan) for SaaS based usage
    + On-Prem or Datacenter - On-prem deployment using Helm-charts

??? "**2. How AccuKnox helps achieve protection for Edge, 5G workloads?**"
    With edge computing shifting towards containerized workloads and in few cases to orchestrated kubernetes workloads, it becomes important to have a security solution which can not only provide enforcement into different forms of deployment but can also provide real-time container-rich observability.
    KubeArmor supporting un-orchestrated containers, k8s workloads and bare metal VMs makes it an ideal universal engine. Its kernel-level runtime security enforcement and container aware observability brings the best of both worlds.

??? "**3. What happens if the AccuKnox Control Plane goes down? Will runtime protection still work?**"
    Yes. Runtime security enforcement continues even if the Control Plane is unavailable. The availability of the Control Plane does not impact the customer’s Data Plane or production operations.

??? "**4. Can AccuKnox be deployed in a distributed architecture?**"
    Yes. AccuKnox can deploy its Control Plane across multiple regions to achieve redundancy and disaster recovery.

    + Uses **native Kubernetes concepts** for distributed deployment.
    + Nodes can span multiple Availability Zones (AZs) and regions.
    + **Requirement:** Reliable network bandwidth between AZs/regions.

??? "**5. Can AccuKnox reuse existing infrastructure (e.g., NAT, firewalls) during on-prem deployment of the Control Plane?**"
    AccuKnox requires an **independent Kubernetes cluster** for deployment. We strongly recommend **not** using an existing cluster running customer applications.

??? "**6. Does AccuKnox integrate with virtualization platforms such as VMware or Hyper-V?**"
    AccuKnox does not integrate directly with virtualization platforms (VMware, Hyper-V, KVM, Nutanix AHV).

    + Instead, AccuKnox secures VMs created on these platforms.
    + Security is provided either **agentlessly (via snapshots)** or through **lightweight scanning agents**.

??? "**7. What is the typical timeline for a Proof of Concept (PoC)?**"
    Typical PoC timelines are:
    + **SaaS PoC:** ~1–2 weeks (infrastructure already in place).
    + **On-Prem PoC:** ~2–3 weeks (depends on environment complexity and readiness).
    + **Air-gapped On-Prem:** Additional time required for staging container images.

    *Note:* In some cases where prerequisites are fully prepared, on-prem deployment has been completed in just a few hours.

    + [POC Checklist Questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/129ZEMzo7oaKRyifprFFRXLf4J6lE7XypBj7Vp9PdXWU/edit?usp=sharing)

??? "**8. For onprem deployment of AccuKnox Control Plane, what are the challenges/considerations?**"
    AccuKnox supports deployment in completely isolated environments, but some considerations apply:
    + **Vulnerability Database Updates:** In SaaS environments, updates are twice daily. In isolated deployments, customers must configure automated pipelines to push updates.
    + **Container Images:** Customers must stage required container images in their private registry. AccuKnox provides the image list and instructions.
    + **Monitoring & Alerts:** In SaaS, AccuKnox SRE practices provide automated monitoring and notifications. In isolated setups, customers need equivalent procedures.
    + **Backups:** Customers must configure backup/snapshot procedures, supported by AccuKnox SRE/DevOps.

??? "**9. Does AccuKnox support backup and auditing in isolated deployments?**"
    Yes. Customers should configure **backup and snapshot procedures** in coordination with AccuKnox SRE/DevOps. In isolated deployments, customers are responsible for setting up monitoring and audit workflows, while AccuKnox provides guidance and support.
