## **Cloud Workloads**

After onboarding your Cluster (managed/ unmanaged), you should be able to visualize cloud workloads with metrics and alerts. You can interact with the cloud workload for monitoring and understanding your application. For example, you can visualize connectivity between microservices and then can instantly drill into the per-layer alerts generated, assess compliance and investigate incidents, all without leaving Cloud Workloads Screen.
