## **Inventory**

 

We ensure that you have an Inventory view of all the cloud resources (infra or app) from the onboarded cloud account or cluster. Once you have the visibility, you can create specific monitoring to the sensitive assets, set baseline against group of assets or drill-down to see details of the asset with respect to findings, tickets or alerts associated to it.

 

## **Assets**

After onboarding your Cloud Account, we assess for cloud resources categorized in following 

Asset Types -

+ Cloud Account - This will be the total number of Cloud Account associated to a particular tenant

+ Hosts - This will inform you about the number of instances across cloud 

+ Apps - This will inform you about the application related cloud resources like load balancer etc.

+ Web/API - This will be the Web/API related cloud information

+ Containers - This will be the total count of containers across all Cloud Accounts of a tenant

+ Cluster - This will be the total count of Cluster across all Cloud Accounts of a tenant

+ Packages - This will be the dynamic packages or binary detected across all Cloud Accounts of a tenant

This should give you an organized view into your cloud resources across multi-cloud and enable you to track most sensitive assets or assets of your interest.
