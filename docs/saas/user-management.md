AccuKnox SaaS provides the ability to authenticate and authorize multiple users to access and utilize the Saas platform. Inside the user management section user can create profiles for other users and these profiles are displayed in form of a list. From the list, users can View Permissions, Edit, Deactivate, and delete user profiles. Permission is given to users by assigning roles while creating a user profile. These roles are created in the RBAC section. Deactivated users can be viewed under the Deactivated Users subsection. Creating a user sends an invite to their email id, invites that are not yet accepted are present inside the Pending Invites subsection.
