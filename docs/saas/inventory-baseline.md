## **Baseline**

One of the most common use-cases is that periodical scans of the cloud infra produces a lot of noise and hence for the mission critical workload or resources, we can set up baselines which is kind of a benchmark leveraged from multiple ‘data source’ that AccuKnox supports like Prowler, Sonarqube etc. and have your resources periodical check for conformance against those benchmarks through our feature called - Drift Detection
