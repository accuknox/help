CWPPs provide consistent visibility and control for physical machines, virtual machines (VMs), containers and serverless workloads, regardless of location. Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) solutions help protect your cloud infrastructure workloads from security threats. CWPP solution detects the vulnerabilities or threats and provides ways to enforce the protection from threats. It achieves this with help enforcement of security policy that protects the cloud workloads from these threats.
