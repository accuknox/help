# **Need for CNAPP:** 

In recent times many companies are switching their legacy deployments to cloud-based deployments. So in the cloud Native deployments security plays a major role. Because in the Cloud deployments cycle the developers use various open-source tools to develop their code and in the deploying face these codes are packaged into images which are then run using the Infrastructure as code components in the cloud. This process of code build, deployment, and run is happening faster in cloud deployments. Hence cloud Native security is the most important factor that one must not ignore. 

 

In the cloud-native deployment phases, there can be many security issues like vulnerable code, Insecure configurations, and Hardcoded secrets in the code-building phase. In the deploying phase, there can issue with malicious images, image poisoning, insecure CI/CD pipelines, etc. In the final phase, there can be issues like runtime security issues like zero-day attacks, Crypto mining data exfiltrations, malware, and vulnerabilities that are still left out un-detected, etc.

There are multiple tools that are available to provide security in various stages of the Software Development Life cycle. But using these tools at different stages becomes difficult as there is no common connectivity between these tools to get reports and findings. Hence we need a separate single tool that provides end-to-end solutions for cloud security from the development to the production process. Therefore Cloud Native Application Protection Platform tool which is a one-stop solution that integrates various results and normalizes/correlates the findings to provide complete security to the cloud resources becomes the need of the hour.
