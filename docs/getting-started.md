# AccuKnox Enterprise Architecture

Welcome to the AccuKnox Enterprise CNAPP Suite, your comprehensive solution for cloud-native application protection. AccuKnox is designed to offer end-to-end security throughout the software development lifecycle, integrating various security measures to ensure robust defense across all deployment phases.

## Cloud-Native Deployment Challenges

In cloud-native deployments, security challenges can arise at different stages -

1. **Code Build Phase**: Issues like vulnerable code, insecure configurations, and hardcoded secrets.

2. **Deployment Phase**: Problems with malicious images, image poisoning, and insecure CI/CD pipelines.

3. **Final Phase**: Runtime security threats such as zero-day attacks, crypto-mining, data exfiltrations, and undetected malware.

## **AccuKnox Solution**

AccuKnox CNAPP Unified cloud-native security platform addressing security across software development lifecycle

### **Key Security Phases**

- Development: Vulnerable code, insecure configs, hardcoded secrets
- Deployment: Malicious images, CI/CD pipeline risks
- Runtime: Zero-day attacks, crypto mining, data exfiltration

### **Core CNAPP Challenges**

- Fragmented security tools
- Lack of integrated reporting
- Disconnected security findings

### **Technical Capabilities**

- Static and dynamic security measures
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- SIEM tool compatibility (Jira, Slack, Splunk, Rsyslog)
- Normalized security findings correlation

## **Security Layers**

- **Identity Management**: Kubernetes Identity and Entitlement Management (KIEM)

- **Static Security**: Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)

- **Run-time Security**: Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP)

## **Unique Differentiators**

- Zero-Trust Security implements allow-based policies to ensure that only specific actions are permitted, following the principle of "never trust, always verify."

- Multi-Cloud Coverage for a consolidated dashboard and asset inventory across multiple cloud accounts.

- Multi-tool integration for a unified risk assessment view across cloud, container, cluster, and code assets (4C coverage).

- Inline Mitigation prevents attacks in real-time using advanced Linux Security Modules (LSMs) like AppArmor, BPF-LSM, and SELinux.

- Agent-Based and Agentless Scanning supports both methods for comprehensive infrastructure security.

- Shift Left Defense allows proactive thwarting of advanced "Zero Day" attacks by addressing security issues early in the development phase.

- Real-Time Protection with real-time defense mechanisms against zero-day attacks.

- Integrated Testing to incorporate Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Software Composition Analysis (SCA), and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST).

## Compliance

AccuKnox's CNAPP supports over 30 compliance frameworks, including HIPAA, GDPR, SOC2, ISO 27001, and more, ensuring adherence to a wide range of industry standards and regulations. We guarantee a robust, unified approach to cloud security that spans all stages of the development lifecycle, providing peace of mind and comprehensive protection against emerging threats.
